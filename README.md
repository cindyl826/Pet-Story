# Pet Story
## Intension
Having a pet is popular among students, people who need companionship, or family with children. However, there is not a go-to platform for people to share their experience about pet caring. Especially for college students who own pets, they may not have enough experience or financial resources to bring their pets to the veterinarians whenever they encounter small problems, so it is essential for these pet owners to have a place where they can get enough information about how to take care of their pets. However, an information problem could be disinformation since anyone will be able to share reviews or thoughts on the platform and those are very subjective information.

Here're two of the existing attempts to solve the problem we're identifying:

[Share your Personal Dog Experiences and Interactions](https://dogloverstore.com/share-personal-dog-experiences-interactions/)<br/>
[Animal World-Pet and Animal Information](https://animal-world.com/)

These two websites both have pages that allows pet owners to share their experience about their interactions with their pets. However, there is not enough participation, and the website does not have a sorting feature and is not organized nicely, so the information would be very messy to the users.

## Website Description
There are several groups of potential users for our proposing application. For instance,people who are beginners in pet-caring or any people who need resources in pet-caring, people who are interested in getting a pet in the near future. Most importantly, experienced pet owners who are willing to share their experience. On this platform,Users will be viewing pet caring reviews written by other pet owners, categorized by food, entertainment, etc, factors that can all be taken into account regarding pets’ health. Users who are considering getting a pet can also view the descriptions of the pets to know the habits or personalities of different species/breed, then decide what kind of pet they want to get.

This app would contain 2 main interactive features:

1. Users can post pet caring experience.They can include what species are their pets and what experience they want to share.
2. Users can view experience posted by others by letting users choose sorted categories. When they are looking for other users’ shared experience on this app, they can sort the information by choosing the species or what kind of experience they want to view.

This application will provide the pet owners a go-to platform when they are in need of pet care information. They don’t need to go online to search over all the websites and gradually gather the information they need, which is very time consuming. In addition, people often ask for pet caring information from their friends who had experience with taking care of pets, but that information can often be lost and cannot be stored and organized into one place. People need to go over a lot of chat histories in order to find the information. By having this all-in-one platform, pet owners can now get all the information they need simply by sorting and searching keywords to get the solution that best fits the situation they are facing.
