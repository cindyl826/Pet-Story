        <p>Users can post pet caring experience and view experience posted by others by letting users choose sorted categories.
            When they are looking for other users’ shared experience on this app, they can sort the information by
            choosing the species or what kind of experience they want to view.

        <p>This application will provide the pet owners a go-to platform when they are in need of pet care information.
            They don’t need to go online to search over all the websites and gradually gather the information they need, which is very time consuming. 
            By having this all-in-one platform, pet owners can now get all the
            information they need simply by sorting and searching keywords
            to get the solution that best fits the situation they are facing.
